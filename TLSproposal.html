<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This document is a revision of P0108R0 @@@ URL @@@ based on discussions
in the SG1 study group in October 2015 in Kona.
P0108R0 was in turn a follow-on to
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4376.html">N4376</a>,
and provides an initial description of a potential solution to the TLS
problem statement implied by that document.

<h2>Summary of Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
We expect that lightweight executors will have problems
with TLS as currently envisioned and implemented.
For example, some types of executors nest hierarchically, so that
a number of light-weight executors might run in the context of
a single heavy-weight <tt>std::thread</tt>.
If a given function accesses TLS, and is called both from the context
of a <tt>std::thread</tt> and from the context of a task executing
within an <tt>std::thread</tt>, what should its TLS accesses do?
If the instances invoked from a task access task-level TLS data,
the function must do different things when invoked in different contexts.
If the <tt>std::thread</tt>-level TLS data is accesses, then the
task-level accesses might introduce data races and thus undefined behavior.

<p>
This also can interact with signal handling.
To see this, suppose that a signal arrives at a
<tt>std::thread</tt> while that <tt>std::thread</tt>
is running a light-weight executor, for example, a task.
The signal handler will likely conceptually be part of the
<tt>std::thread</tt> rather than the task.
This would imply some additional context switching at signal-handler
start and end.

<p>
TLS is most especially a problem for light-weight executors
implementing same-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) units
and general-purpose graphical processing units (GPGPUs)
because large programs can have very large amounts of TLS data,
each item of which might have C++ constructors and destructors.
Spending many milliseconds to run constructors and destructors
for a SIMD computation that only takes a few microseconds to run
is clearly not a reasonably way to achieve high performance.
The use of lazy construction reduces this overhead, but the
occasional &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; taken from processing to
run some constructor might be quite unwelcome.

<p>
GPGPU code often has longer runtimes, but they also tend to run
extremely large numbers of threads, adding a memory-footprint
problem to the constructor-destructor overhead problem.
To make matters worse, in some environments, the constructors and
destructors must be run on heavyweight CPUs rather than on the
lightweight GPGPU hardware threads, which severely restricts the
computational resources that can be applied to run constructors
and destructors for GPGPU TLS data.

<p>
At the source-code level, it isn't generally knowable which executor a
function is called from, or even if a function is called from multiple
executors.
It is left up to the programmer to write code which correctly
accesses state for the executor(s) that the code will execute in.
(In theory, we could of course use a TLS variable to record what type
of executor was currently executing, but in practice that of course
requires a TLS implementation that is efficient enough to be used by
light-weight executors, and if we had that, we wouldn't be writing
this paper.)

<h2>Tentative Goals</h2>

<p>
There are a number of possible ways of resolving this issue, as discussed in
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4376.html">N4376</a>,
however, this paper focuses on the possibility that TLS is an optional
component of an executor.
With this approach, <tt>std::thread</tt> implements TLS, but lighter-weight
executors might choose not to.

<p>
For this approach, we put forward the following tentative goals:

<ol>
<li>	Make TLS availability optional for light-weight executors,
	as noted above.
	<ol type="alpha">
	<li>	Modify the standard library so as to minimize the
		number of standard library functions that are
		prohibited from within TLS-free executors.
	<li>	Maintain the performance and scalability of high-quality
		standard-library implementations.
	</ol>
<li>	Avoid source-code changes for existing code running in
	existing executors (such as <tt>std::thread</tt>) that
	provide TLS.
<li>	Avoid the need to recompile existing code running in
	existing executors (such as <tt>std::thread</tt>) that
	provide TLS.
<li>	Avoid API changes in the standard library.
	(C++ only, as it seems quite unlikely that this goal can be
	achieved in C.)
<li>	Recruit sanitizer developers to help identify issues in
	new code and in standard-library code related to this change.
</ol>

<p>
The next section exercises these goals by attempting to apply them
to the TLS <tt>errno</tt> facility as used by the standard math library,
in the hope of sparking productive discussion.
Note that when multiple lightweight executors run concurrently in the
context of a single <tt>std::thread</tt>, setting <tt>errno</tt>
implicitly (and for some, surprisingly) invokes
undefined behavior, so a fix is a matter of some importance.
At a minimum, lightweight executors that do not support TLS need to
state that attempts to access TLS results in undefineed behavior.

<h2>The Curious Case of <tt>errno</tt> and the Standard Math Library</h2>

<p>
C++ provides a per-<tt>std::thread</tt> facility named
<tt>errno</tt> (19.4) in order to provide POSIX compatibility.
This is also required to allow C++'s standard math library (26)
maintain compatibility with that of C.
Section 7.12 of the C standard specifies that if
<tt>math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO</tt> is non-zero, indication of
certain errors are available via <tt>errno</tt>.
Furthermore, Section 19.4 of the C++ standard specifies that
<tt>errno</tt> is provided on a per-thread basis.
Therefore, <tt>errno</tt> is frequently implemented using TLS,
which in turn means that the math library's use of <tt>errno</tt>
forms an excellent initial test case for changes to TLS.

<p>
This section looks at the following approaches:

<ol>
<li>	Restricting configuration.
<li>	Adding <tt>errno</tt> parameter via function overloading.
<li>	Adding <tt>errno</tt> to return value.
<li>	Limit TLS via a class-hierarchy-like approach.
<li>	Use IEEE NaNs or other machine state to record errors.
</ol>

<h3>Restricting Configuration</h3>

<p>
One approach is to require that
<tt>math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT</tt> be non-zero
(as is required for IEC 60559) and that
<tt>math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO</tt> be zero in all cases where
math library functions are invoked from executors that do not provide TLS.
Note that <tt>math_errhandling</tt> is global and constant, which means
that it cannot have different values in different contexts of the same
execution.
However, this approach cannot be used in conjunction with existing code
that invokes math functions and tests <tt>errno</tt>.
This could in turn be dealt with by forbidding use of code
that checks for math errors using <tt>errno</tt>, but this would have
the undesirable effect of acting as a barrier to the adoption of
light-weight executors.

<h3>Adding <tt>errno</tt> Parameter Via Function Overloading</h3>

<p>
Another approach is to use function overloading, so that an additional
<tt>double sqrt(double, int *)</tt> declaration could be used in
light-weight executors.
Note that in some implemnetations this could require modifying the
underlying C library in order to bypass <tt>errno</tt> setting.
Code invoked both from light-weight and heavy-weight executors would
need to use the new delaration, but code invoked only from
heavy-weight executors could continue using the old API, consistent
with the goals preserving existing source and binary code.
It is tempting to instead overload on the return value, but C++
of course does not support this notion.
A (probably partial) list of new APIs is as follows:

<li>	<tt>long double fmal(long double x, long double y, long double z, int *errnm);</tt>
</ul>

<p>
Note that new APIs need be provided only for those math functions that
set <tt>errno</tt>.
Note also that because C does not provide function overloading,
different names will need to be used should C adopt similar functionality.

<p>One might expect some dissatisfaction with the invention of more than
100 new functions, especially given that a great many uses of these functions
ignore <tt>errno</tt>.
Although one can argue that ignoring <tt>errno</tt> is a bad idea,
one might also expect strenuous objections to pointless modifications
of existing errno-ignoring code.

<h3>Adding <tt>errno</tt> to Function Return Value</h3>

Another approach is to define an additional namespace containing
definitions of these functions that return a tuple that includes both
the normal return value and the <tt>errno</tt> value.
For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
 1 std::tuple&lt;T, errno_t&gt; acos(T);
 2 
 3 template&lt;typename T&gt; struct math_result {
 4   explicit math_result(T);
 5   explicit math_result(errno_t);
 6   T operator T() const;
 7 errno_t error() const;
 8   // Implementation-defined.
 9 };
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This approach allows errno-ignoring code to run safely in light-weight
executors, with modest changes for code that pays attention to errno.
One way of preventing silent miscomputation by errno-ignoring code
is to use exceptions, which this approach also supports.
However, some might take exception to the use of exceptions, given that
a number of current implementations of exceptions use, you guessed it,
TLS!

<h3>Machine Registers: The Ultimate TLS Implementation</h3>

<p>
The logically extreme TLS implementation is a reserved machine register,
so extreme <tt>errno</tt> would simply reserve a register for errno.
If common code was to be invoked from both light-weight and heavy-weight
executors, a simple solution is to always reserve a register for
<tt>errno</tt>.

<p>
Of course, this approach simply does not scale with increasing numbers
of TLS objects, as even modern machines
have a rather limited number of registers.
In addition, some TLS constructors might not react well to finding that
all of their data was in machine registers, especially those constructors
expecting to create linked structures.
Neverthless, this approach might work well for restricted quantities of
TLS data, such as that which might be needed for a non-hosted small-library
implementation.

<h3>Applying Lessons from Class Hierarchies</h3>

<p>
Suppose that we (very loosely) modeled TLS data with a class-like
hierarchy.
The &ldquo;base class&rdquo; would contain only that TLS data required by the
core language, and &ldquo;subclasses&rdquo; would add TLS data required by
libraries and by the user application.
Ignoring the analogies with abstract classes for the moment, light-weight
executors might confine themselves to TLS data relatively high up in
this TLS hierarchy, while heavy-weight executors might take the entire
class hierarchy, lock, stock, and barrel.

<p>
Any executor expecting to use the math library would need to maintain
that part of the TLS hierarchy containing <tt>errno</tt>.
Future work might identify a minimum subset for various types of
executors.

<h3>Use Hardware State (NaNs) to Record Errors</h3>

<p>
IEEE floating-point not-a-number (NaN) values were designed to
record error conditions and to flow them through the remainder of the
computation.
Non-IEEE hardware often has other facilities for this purpose,
and some IEEE hardware has cheaper ways to maintain this information.

<p>
The key point here is to provide an API to read this information out.
The API must take a floating-point number as input for the NaN case,
however, implementations that do not use NaNs are free to ignore
this number and instead read out hardware state.
The return value is an integer errno.

<blockquote>
<pre>
int recent_fp_errno(float x);
int recent_dp_errno(double x);
int recent_ldp_errno(long double x);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This approach only applies to functions that return a floating-point
number.
Functions that return integral types (integer log functions and
round-to-integer functions) must continue to set errno in those
implementations supporting errno.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
This document has examined some ways to permit light-weight executors
to avoid implementing TLS.
Your ideas are more than welcome!

<p>
Future work includes handling of
allocators (which introduces the problem of cross-executor freeing),
setjmp/longjmp,
locales,
filesystems,
signal handling,
floating-point rounding modes (and everything else in <tt>fenv</tt>),
exceptions,
and alternate-stack pointers.
The problem of nested executors that all provide TLS is also left
unaddressed by this draft.
In addition, and perhaps most important, future work includes guidelines
and patterns to allow user code to work well with TLS in environments
that include lightweight executors.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>
Floating-point state is stored on a per-thread basis, which means that
if a light-weight executor can be preempted or migrated among
<tt>std::thread</tt> instance, things like rounding modes and
error/exception indications can be subject to unscheduled revision.
